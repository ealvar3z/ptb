HACKER BEBOP.

they say that jazz is broad term,

in that same token,  i ask you the following dear reader:

  what would be the equivalent of a gumbo for technical terms?

... ok you're done. here is the answer: phreaking.

don't believe me?

think about the level of depth and implicit knowledge that phreakers had
when they were compromising systems. they operated at L3 and below w/
impugnity.

these same individuals, upon mastering networking and exploits at the
physical layer & above; it was only inevitable that most of them went on
to the NSA, CTOs @ great firms, and/or undercover-hide-in-plain-sight
leader of the cDc.

ok, back to jazz now...

do yourself a solid and search for a copy of ```COWBOY BEBOP OST``` in
youtube, lay back and feel the bebop.

- Mata ne!.
