LOCAL VIMRC, GLOBAL SANITY

There is a quiet engineering problem most Vim users eventually run into:
where should project-specific behavior live?

If every tweak goes into your global vimrc, it turns into an uncurated junk
drawer. If you avoid customization entirely, you lose speed and consistency
inside projects that clearly benefit from local semantics.

The combination of `set exrc` and `set nosecure` gives you an honest middle
path. That means project concerns stay in the project. A blog repo can have
commands for post scaffolding. A Go service can have build/test mappings.  A
docs repo can have prose-friendly text settings. None of that needs to leak
into your universal editing defaults.

The payoff is immediate:

- a lean global vimrc that remains understandable months later;
- faster onboarding when you return to old repositories;
- fewer accidental keymap collisions between unrelated domains;
- configuration that documents project intent in a practical way.

In short, a local vim config is not only clever, it reduces mental load. With
this approach, every repository can carry only the behaviors that make sense
for that repository.

For example, this blog has one: it includes things like a `:NewPost` command
that creates files using my desired slug format (YYYYMMDD_slug.txt), plus
insert helpers for HTML markup. This is exactly the kind of ergonomics you
want nearby, not globally active while editing unrelated code.

There is, however, one rule that matters more than convenience: trust
boundary.  A local vimrc is executable configuration. If you enable this
workflow, you should do it only for repositories you trust and understand. See

Used responsibly, local vimrc via `exrc` and `nosecure` is one of the cleanest
ways to keep your editor sharp: stable global defaults, local project power,
and no permanent clutter.
