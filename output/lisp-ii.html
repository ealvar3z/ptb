    <pre>LISP (PART 2).

In my last post, I left your with a thought experiment: how do Lisp, C and
Fortran embody the UNIX philosophy, but in different dimensions? If you've
been pondering this, let me help you.

At its core, the UNIX philosophy can be steeped down to:

  * do one thing well.  
  * compose small tools into larger systems.  
  * text is a universal interface.

It's a philosophy of simplicity, modularity, and extensibility. Yet, when we
look at Lisp, C and Fortran (three languages w/ very different fundamental
units of data); they all reflect the UNIX philosophy in their own unique way. I
posit the following:

  * C is       -> UNIX in the systems dimension.
  * Fortran is -> UNIX in the computational dimension.
  * Lisp is    -> UNIX in the abstract dimension.  

Once one realizes that each of these programming languages forces the
programmer to think in these dimensions, the rest simply follows. For example,
Lisp is built on S-expressions. It's "small tool" are its atomic forms: `car`,
`cdr`, `cons`, and `lambda`. Due to this level of simplicity, one is allowed to
compose complex abstractions from these primitives. As in UNIX pipes, Lisp
thrives in composition via macros, functions, and higher-order functions (same
applies to functional paradigms). In other words:

  * macros                  -> generate hygienic code
  * functions               -> manipulate lists
  * higher-order-functions  -> extend behavior

Therefore, Lisp embodies UNIX in the abstract, self-referential way, i.e.
programs that manipulate programs, infinitely extensible through its own
structures. As such, it makes sense, as to why Lisp projects are "monolithic"
in architecture, because to me Lisp is biological, and nature always
self-organizes in emerging complex systems. One can see an example of this in
Emacs: an entire Lisp ecosystem built around a text editor.

I'll leave you with this: if the UNIX philosophy is so universal, what other
dimensions do you see it manifesting in? Perhaps we'll explore that next time.
