        <pre>HELLO, READERS.

i am here, in a world spun too fast,
where old shall be new, and the thoughts do not wait,
and the nights do not forget.

this is not a manifesto, sermon or innuendo.
this is my place.
a place for the overlooked, the ones tired of
bloat, fast-movers &amp; experiencing tech with no hope.

i offer misshapen prose and half-told tales,
the poetry found in dried-out bales.

a blog, sure. but perhaps more.
maybe the faint echo of a commodore 64.
or the quiet hum of an old typewriter in a room full of books.
where there is no such things as halfway crooks.

the world is noisy, but the night is tender. Let this be
your place to roam in a world full of cybernetic shells.
let&#39;s see where this goes, shall we?

- Welcome.
