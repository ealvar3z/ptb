HACKER BEBOP.

they say that jazz is broad term,

in that same token,  i ask you the following dear reader:

  what would be the equivalent of hacking's gumbo for technical terms?

..... ok you're done. here is the answer: phreaking.

don't believe me?

think about the level of depth and implicit knowledge that phreakers
had when they were compromising systems. they operated at L3 (i.e. layer 3)
and below w/ impugnity.

these same individuals, once having to understand networking, exploits at the
physical layer, it was only inevitable that most of those individuals went on
to the NSA, CTOs @ great firms, and/or undercover-hide-in-plain-sight leader
of the cDc.

so, the next time you think about jazz or attempt to define jazz. remember of
the gumbo pot that the genre sits in. in that same token, the same can be applied
to technology. therefore: a jazz bebop is just as random, cool, _and_ accomplished
as a _cowboy bebop_ aka *hacker bebop*

- Happy Hacking.
