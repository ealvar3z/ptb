        <pre>HACKER BEBOP.

they say that jazz is a broad term,

in that same token,  i ask you the following dear reader:

  what would be the equivalent of a gumbo for technical terms?

... ok you&#39;re done. here is the answer: phreaking.

don&#39;t believe me?

think about the level of depth and implicit knowledge that phreakers had
when they were compromising systems. they operated at L3 and below w/
impugnity.

these same individuals, upon mastering networking and telephony exploits
at the physical layer &amp; above; flourished in this gumbo we call the
internet. it was only inevitable that most of them went on to the NSA,
CTOs @ great firms, and/or undercover-hide-in-plain-sight leaders of the
cDc.

ok, back to jazz now...

do yourself a solid and search for a copy of ```COWBOY BEBOP OST``` in
youtube, lay back and feel the bebop.
