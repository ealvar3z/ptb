      <description>LOCAL VIMRC, GLOBAL SANITY There is a quiet engineering problem most Vim users eventually run into: where should project-specific behavior live? If every tweak goes into your global vimrc, it turns into an uncurated junk drawer. If you avoid customization entirely, you lose speed...</description>

      <description>STOCHASTIC-QUANTUM THEOREM. I was listening to the following &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3Ms4acb6SUY&#34;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; the other day, which led me down an academic rabbit-hole: &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03085&#34;&gt;Jacob Barandes&#39; Stochastic-Quantum Theorem&lt;/a&gt;. To appreciate...</description>

      <description>UNIX as an IDE II. Last article, I&#39;ve mentioned that I would report back after giving emacs a full rundown to serve as my computing environment. Therefore, this will be a very short blog post for reasons that the reader may be able to foretell. Emacs does stereotypically fulfill ...</description>

      <description>UNIX as an IDE. This title is a little bit misleading, as it is more about configuration and dotfiles hell more than anything else. To get a sense for the title of this post, I rather refer you to the article that inspired me to stay on the &#34;path&#34; &lt;https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/se...</description>

      <description>LISP (PART 2). In my last post, I left your with a thought experiment: how do Lisp, C and Fortran embody the UNIX philosophy, but in different dimensions? If you&#39;ve been pondering this, let me help you. At its core, the UNIX philosophy can be steeped down to: * do one thing well....</description>

      <description>LISP. For as long as I can remember, there has always been a quiet tension between the UNIX way and the monolithic style inherent to Lisp. The GNU system embodies this monolith within a UNIX-like environment. This isn’t a revelation, for the name itself recursively spells it ou...</description>

      <description>HELLO, READERS. i am here, in a world spun too fast, where old shall be new, and the thoughts do not wait, and the nights do not forget. this is not a manifesto, sermon or innuendo. this is my place. a place for the overlooked, the ones tired of bloat, fast-movers &amp; experiencing ...</description>
