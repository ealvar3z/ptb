        <pre>UNIX as an IDE II.

Last article, I&#39;ve mentioned that I would report back after giving emacs a full
rundown to serve as my computing environment. Therefore, this will be a very
short blog post for reasons that the reader may be able to foretell.

EMACS does stereotypically fulfill the operating system moniker. My experience
you may ask? ... it was amazing. However ... as great as EMACS is and was for
me, I still find myself goig back to:

- ed -&gt; sam -&gt; vi 
- sh/bash -&gt; Perl/Python
- C/Go -&gt; Scheme/OCaml

What I&#39;ve learned is that one&#39;s computing environment has to both be enjoyable
and productive. The productive part: EMACS covered it! The enjoyable part, not
so much! Subjective reason: me!. Objective reason: none!.

To re-iterate, it was not EMACS or the ecosystem, the community, _et al_.
It was simple: me!!! As much as I love lisp, ocaml, and the hackability of
EMACS; I have gotten so used to the simplicity of ed/sam/vi, that I find it
hard to give up editing in anything else.

In the end, the console only experience was a fresh of breath air, as I&#39;ve
eluded to already.

- Mata ne!
