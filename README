[P]lain [T]ext [B]log

A minimalistic static site generator in Go.

How to use:
----------

Simple, write all your blog posts in plaintext.
Put it in the `txt` directory, and Go will serve
it from there.

```shell
touch txt/loren-ipsum.txt
ed !$
# write some distracted free prose
\.
wq
go run main.go
```

Voila! Go will do the rest.


Incoming features:
-----------------

In the near future, I plan to add datestamps, a nav bar and
some refactoring it. PRs are welcome.
